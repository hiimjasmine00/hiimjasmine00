üëãüèø I'm Jasmine, that one girl that contributes to [Geode](https://github.com/geode-sdk) a lot.

I'm also the developer of many Geometry Dash mods, the most popular of which being [More Icons](https://github.com/hiimjasmine00/MoreIcons). You'll also see me moderating the [Geode Mod Index](https://geode-sdk.org/mods), the largest collection of Geometry Dash mods.

My main languages are JavaScript and TypeScript, with some knowledge of C#, Java, and C++. Sometimes I handle other programming languages with a "Fake it until you make it" mentality.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can find me on Discord at @hiimjasmine00. I also accept DMs from Twitter/X, Reddit, and Bluesky.
